### Deamosets manage and use cases in Kubernetes ###

A DaemonSet defines Pods that provide node-local facilities. 
These might be fundamental to the operation of your cluster, 
such as a networking helper tool, or be part of an add-on

A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. 
As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them.
As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. 
Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

running a cluster storage daemon on every node
running a logs collection daemon on every node
running a node monitoring daemon on every node
running a node networking daemon on every node

currently: kube-proxy ; kube-flannel ( or any network related)
storage: CSi Driver like rancher ebs nfs

# kubectl get ds -A 

### differance between deployment and daemonsetes 

- deployment give application deployment and manage, rollout revison and history, replica manage 
- ds used for specfic case like nework storage to ensure pod run on every node 
- kube-proxy flannel csi driver
