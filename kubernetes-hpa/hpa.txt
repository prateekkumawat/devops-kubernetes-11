Horizontal scaling means that the response to increased load is to deploy more Pods. 
This is different from vertical scaling, which for Kubernetes would mean assigning more resources 
(for example: memory or CPU) to the Pods that are already running for the workload.

- If the load decreases, and the number of Pods is above the configured minimum

Horizontal pod autoscaling does not apply to objects that can't be scaled (for example: a DaemonSet.)
