# NodeSelector:::
- simplest way to assign pod to  node 
- NodeSelector is working on basis of node label
- Kubernetes only schedules the Pod onto nodes that have each of the labels you specify. 
- Limitation: there is not logical based assign just simple based on label match deploy pod. 


# affinity and Antiaffinity:::
- Affinity and anti-affinity expand the types of constraints you can define.
- affinity/anti-affinity language is more expressive. nodeSelector only selects nodes with all the specified labels.
- Affinity/anti-affinity gives you more control over the selection logic.
- There are two types of node affinity:
   requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: The scheduler can't schedule the Pod unless the rule is met.
   preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: The scheduler tries to find a node that meets the rule. If a matching node is not available, 
   the scheduler still schedules the Pod.

Taints are the opposite -- they allow a node to repel a set of pods.

Tolerations are applied to pods. Tolerations allow the scheduler to schedule pods with matching taints.
 Tolerations allow scheduling but don't guarantee scheduling
